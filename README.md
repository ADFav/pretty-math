Object-oriented representations of mathematical concepts

This project grew out of a need to develop a way to generate unique homework assignments for students. In Algebra II class, we deal a lot with polynomial functions and related functions (rational functions, radical functions, etc.). To aid in creating unique problems, I needed a wrapper class in Javascript, which I could then import to Google Docs to quickly create different problems.

### Stack
- Javascript
- Google Apps Script
- Google Sheets (to an extent)
